Week 1
We formed the group and select the Movie Finder System as our project topic.
We discussed the programming framework, and decided to use JavaScript as front-end programming language, and python as back-end programming language.


Week 2
We proposed 8 functions, and assign task to everyone.
I will be responsible for the front-end part of the system.
I decide to use React framework, and use AntDesign as UI library.
